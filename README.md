# Heaps & Shortest Path Performance Analysis

**Binary Heap vs Fibonacci Heap vs Hollow Heap in Dynamic Shortest Path Problems**

##  Overview

This project is a comparative case study that evaluates the performance of three advanced heap data structures — **Binary Heap**, **Fibonacci Heap**, and **Hollow Heap** — when used as priority queues within **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm**.

All heap structures are implemented from scratch and integrated into a generic Dijkstra framework. The system measures runtime efficiency, heap operations performance, and structural properties under dynamic routing conditions.

The project also includes large-scale performance testing using graph datasets of different sizes and densities.

##  Learning Objectives

* Implement Binary Heap, Fibonacci Heap, and Hollow Heap from scratch.
* Compare theoretical vs empirical performance.
* Integrate heaps into Dijkstra’s algorithm using a generic priority queue interface.
* Evaluate:

  * insert
  * extract-min
  * decrease-key operations
* Record heap structural properties:

  * height
  * number of trees
  * consolidation behavior
* Generate analytical insights and performance comparisons.

##  Case Study Background

A smart logistics company manages automated delivery routing where traffic conditions change in real-time. Edge weights frequently update, requiring repeated shortest-path recomputation.

Since Dijkstra’s algorithm relies heavily on priority queue operations (especially decrease-key), selecting the optimal heap structure significantly affects performance, memory usage, and scalability.

This project simulates that environment to determine the most efficient heap structure.

## Project Tasks

1. Implement Binary Heap, Fibonacci Heap, and Hollow Heap.
2. Integrate each heap with Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.
3. Run experiments on multiple graph datasets.
4. Record:

   * operation execution time
   * heap structural statistics
5. Compare results and produce analytical insights.

## ⚙️ Implementation Requirements

### Heap Operations

Each heap must support:

* `insert(key, value)`
* `find_min()`
* `extract_min()`
* `decrease_key(node, new_key)`
* `delete(node)` *(optional for Binary Heap)*

### Integration

* Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm using a **generic PriorityQueue interface**.
* Swap heap implementations without changing algorithm logic.

## 📊 Performance Measurement

### Execution Metrics

Measure:

* Total runtime of Dijkstra per heap
* Average operation time:

  * insert
  * extract_min
  * decrease_key

### Structural Metrics

For Fibonacci and Hollow heaps record:

* Heap height
* Number of trees in root list
* Number of cascading cuts (Fibonacci)
